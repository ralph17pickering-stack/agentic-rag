# Plan: Clickable Metadata Category Filtering

**Status: Completed**

✅ **Simple** - Single-pass executable, low risk

## Context
Documents in DocumentsPanel display topic tags as static badges below each file. The feature request is to make these badges clickable so users can filter the document list to only show files matching a selected category. This is a purely client-side change — no backend or DB modifications needed.

## Approach
Add local filter state to `DocumentsPanel`. When a topic badge is clicked, toggle it in the active filter set. Filter the rendered document list to only show docs containing at least one selected topic. Clicking an active filter deselects it; a "Clear filters" chip removes all active filters. Active filter badges render with a distinct visual style (filled/primary color vs. outline when inactive).

## Files Modified
- `app/frontend/src/components/documents/DocumentsPanel.tsx`

## Changes Made
1. Added `X` to lucide-react imports
2. Added `activeTopics` state (`Set<string>`) and `toggleTopic` handler
3. Added `filteredDocs` derived value (passthrough when empty, filtered otherwise)
4. Added active filter chips UI between info message and document list
5. Converted topic `<span>` badges to `<button>` with active/inactive styling and `stopPropagation`
6. Updated list render to use `filteredDocs`
7. Added "no documents match filter" empty state
